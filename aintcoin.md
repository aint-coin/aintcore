I'm building a Bitcoin of new generation.I know that everybody is saying stuff like that,but I've actually studied crypto and experimented for 7 years now as a developer and I'm quite certain I've pinpointed all problems and issues that Bitcoin and crypto in general have. Thread.

First of all, let me say - Bitcoin is awesome. I don't think we need to change it dramatically, but I also think changing it a little to allow some data won't destroy it. Bitcoin is extremely resilient and its resiliency is rooted in its name and brand, not its tech.

For me, Bitcoin has two main purposes:

- store of value for the poor to fight inflation
- anonymous funding of new projects that can build upon Satoshi's ideal

There are also few things it does really bad. People get freaked out by its volatility and don't see it as money.

One of my most controversial takes as a cypherpunk is that dollar is an amazing tool. Extremely powerful, more powerful than nuclear energy. And just like any tool including nuclear technology, it can be used for good and evil. The world is currently using it in evil ways.

What makes this amazing tool such a bad tool in hand of evil people are these facts:

- its lack of transparency
- centralization
- monopoly (as opposed to decentralization)

If we could copy dollar into DeFi, we would have made a tool that would lead us into Star Trek society.

If we look into history of finance and monetary systems, we will see constant copying of old solutions to crypto and going through all phases that traditional financial system went through and we're getting attacked by them in the same time. We are reinventing (a better) wheel.

This leads me back to Bitcoin.Bitcoin is our semi-anonymous Internet gold. It's not a great tech (except for invention of blockchain), it's slow, too transparent etc.But for us who build anonymously on the Internet,it's basically the only way to get funding while being anonymous.

Once we have digital gold, our logical next step if unstoppable trustless gold (Bitcoin) standard system of commercial NGO smart contracts and cryptography based banks. But have no doubt, modern fiat system like dollar is by far superior to gold standard. And we should chase it.

So far,all big true algorithmic stable coins have failed. Stables like Luna and Neutrino.And they failed because they were based on equivalent of gold standard. They were over collateralized with a volatile asset that was too volatile for the stable to endure hostile bad players.

Their biggest weakness was that they had no spending. Maintaining modern fiat stable is largely based on spending. You trust dollar because you know that world is forced to use it to trade oil so you know you’ll always be able to exchange it for something else of worth.

And this is where Aintcoin comes into play. Let's build an algorithmic stable coin with PoS consensus (coin A) which will be used as electricity to mine an equivalent of Bitcoin (token B) while token C represents the power of the miner. I call it Virtual Proof of Work - VPoW.

As I said,Bitcoin,PoW and blockchain are all awesome tech. However,BTC is wasting huge amounts of value simply to prove individual players good intentions. For those purposes,it’s enough to simply spend the coin itself.But why give that value away when the coin itself can get it?

This is the kind of chain Aintcoin / ATC is. Instead of empowering those who can afford electricity, it empowers people who know how to setup nodes and create forks. It quantifies knowledge in this way and uses knowledge instead of electricity as a unit that’s constantly spent.

Aint Chain consist of three main tokens:

- AINT is our native chain PoS token and it's an equivalent of electricity with spending and no max supply
- ANOTE is the token that is an equivalent of power of your ATC miner
- ATC (Aintcoin) is equivalent of BTC with same tokenomics

AINT doesn’t have max supply, only monetary policy (block reward) determined by voting on node level. ANOTE has max supply of 144k and it’s minted with AINT while the minting price is increasing. ATC has a max supply of 21 million and it’s mined by spending AINT.

It will have built-in forking with side chains and that’s how we will achieve scalability. Top level fork will hold information about second and third level forks. Second level forks will hold financial information. Third level forks will hold app level data.

With this we can easily achieve maximum privacy, BTC equivalent which is mined by spending value and that value being redirectable to chain’s value instead of electricity, fungibility, scalability, decentralized development managed by the community and a potential of stable coin.

Nodes can be ran on laptop and desktop computers because it’s PoS on fundamental level, that makes it completely independent of the cloud, we can easily put them behind TOR and even on a mesh network like Meshtastic. Encrypted messaging and currencies is all we need for freedom.

The most important part of this would be what Bitcoin aimed to be - peer to peer electronic cash. But to truly achieve that, it needs to be stable like cash, private and fungible like cash, unstoppable and trustless. And Aintcoin is my vision of that and I’ve built 70% of it.
